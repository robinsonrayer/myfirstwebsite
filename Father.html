        <p> Only Father knows Son and Son knows the Father through Son we came to know about our heavenly Father,Father and Son are consubstantiated, the apostles confess Jesus to be the Word: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God"; as "the image of the invisible God"; as the "radiance of the glory of God and the very stamp of his nature, By calling God "Father", the language of faith indicates two main things: that God is the first origin of everything and transcendent authority; and that he is at the same time goodness and loving care for all his children. God's parental tenderness can also be expressed by the image of motherhood,which emphasizes God's immanence, the intimacy between Creator and creature</p>
